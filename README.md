This repository contains code used to test the effect of the head model on the identifiability matrices to be used for "brain fingerprinting".
The main code is ControlCode_loop.m. The several conditions are described in the paper at . The PCA option refers to the paper "The quest for identifiability in human functional connectomes", https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25089-1.

All the results and identifiability matrices, with names reflecting the several conditions according to the codes defined in the script and functions, are available at https://zenodo.org/records/12795882.
